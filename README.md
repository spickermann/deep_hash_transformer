# DeepHashTransformer

The `DeepHashTransformer` helps to translate keys in deeply nested hash (and array) structures.

In opposite to the ActiveSupport's `deep_transform_keys` method `deep_transform_keys` is the `DeepHashTransformer` able to transform keys in hashes that are stored in nested arrays, for example a structure like this `{ foo: [{ bar: 1 }, { bar: 2 }] }`

A good use-case might be the transformation of a JSON API style hash (dasherized string keys) the was returned by an API to a hash that follows common Ruby idioms (symbolized underscore keys), see [Complex Example](#complex-example) below.

## Installation

Include the gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'deep_hash_transformer'
```

When you are still on Ruby 2.2 â€“ 2.4:

```ruby
gem 'deep_hash_transformer', '~> 1.0.0'
```

When you are still on Ruby 2.1 or below:

```ruby
gem 'deep_hash_transformer', '~> 0.1.1'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install deep_hash_transformer

## Usage

The latest version of the `DeepHashTransformer` has the following key transformation operations implemented:

`:camel_case`
: translates keys into `CamelCase`, example: `"foo_bar" => "FooBar"`

`:dasherize`
: translates underscores in keys into dashes, example: `"foo_bar" => "foo-bar"`

`:identity`
: returns the keys unchanged

`:pascal_case`
: translates keys into `pascalCase`, example: `"foo_bar" => "fooBar"`

`:snake_case`
: translates keys into `snake_case`, example: `"FooBar" => "foo_bar"`

`:stringify`
: translates symbol keys into strings, example `:fooBar => "fooBar"`

`:symbolize`
: translates string keys into symbos, example `"fooBar" => :fooBar`

`:underscore`
: translates dashes in keys into underscores, example: `:foo-bar => "foo_bar"`

All transformation can be called by its name, for example:

```ruby
DeepHashTransformer.new({ foo_bar: 'baz' }).dasherize
#=> { 'foo-bar' => 'baz' }
```

Or you can use `tr` to chain multiple transformations:

```ruby
DeepHashTransformer.new({ 'foo-bar' => 'baz' }).tr(:underscore, :symbolize)
#=> { foo_bar: 'baz' }
```

It is worth noting that the `DeepHashTransformer` only transforms string or symbol keys and leaves other types untouched:

```ruby
DeepHashTransformer.new({ 1 => 'foo', :bar => 'bar', Object => 'baz' }).stringify
#=> { 1 => 'foo', 'bar' => 'bar', Object => 'baz' }
```

All transformations apart from `symbolize` return per default hashes with stringify keys. When you want to have symbolized keys to be returned then use `tr` to chain your required transformation with `:symbolize`

## Complex Example

`DeepHashTransformer` transforms all hash keys - even if the key is nested in another hash or stored in a nested array. This is its biggest advantage over ActiveSupport's `deep_transform_keys` method which is not able to handle hashes in nested arrays.

Example: Transformation of a JSON API style hash (dasherized string keys) to a hash that follows common Ruby idioms (symbolized underscore keys).

```ruby
json_api_style = {
  'nested-array' => [
    { 'a-key' => 'a-value' }
  ],
  'foo_bar' => 'baz'
}

DeepHashTransformer.new(json_api_style).tr(:underscore, :symbolize)
#=> {
#     nested_array: [
#       { a_key: 'a-value' }
#     ],
#     foo_bar: 'baz'
#   }
```
